## What I Do

### Enterprise Identity Management
At Nagarro, I manage the full IAM lifecycle including:
- **User provisioning and deprovisioning** across Active Directory, Entra ID, and ISIM
- **Access reviews and recertification** ensuring compliance with security policies
- **Service desk operations** handling 50+ tickets daily with 98% SLA compliance
- **Automation development** reducing manual provisioning time by 67%

### Cloud Architecture
My AWS expertise includes designing and implementing:
- **Three-tier VPC architectures** with defense-in-depth security
- **IAM policies and roles** following least-privilege principles
- **Encryption strategies** using KMS for data protection
- **Audit and compliance** infrastructure with CloudTrail

### Automation & Scripting
I build automation that scales:
- **Python/Boto3** for AWS infrastructure automation
- **PowerShell** for Windows and Active Directory administration
- **ServiceNow integrations** for ticket workflow automation
- **CI/CD pipelines** for infrastructure deployments
